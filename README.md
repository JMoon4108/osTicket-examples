<p>
Manager karen has had reports of issues with online banking and is opening a ticket. (Not all information a user provides may be correct, e.g., Help topic: Report a Problem, the more appropriate would be: Report a Problem / Business Critical Outage)
</p>
<br />

<p>
This is how the ticket would first appear to a help desk agent prior to assigning it to the correct team (if applicable).

<b>Let's update the ticket information so the appropriate team handles the issue.</b>
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
First, update the SLA to the appropriate severity level. (Sev-A)
</p>
<br />

<p>
Next, the help topic so the proper support team knows the scope of work it may entail. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Finally, assign the ticket to the correct team so they can start addressing the issue.

<b>Assigning the team last will make sure you can make all the proper adjustments to the ticket before potentially losing access (only if you do not have access to tickets from the team your assigning it to).</b>
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
This is an updated view of the ticket, all the information has been updated and also the timeline of all edits made to the ticket.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Once a ticket has been reassigned to the correct support team, the team takes over to work the ticket. An individual on the team will usually get it assigned to them or take the assignment themselves so it can be tracked under their name.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
As the suppoort member intracts with the user and resolves the ticket, they will send updates in accordance with the SLA type. These updates and interactions will be saved in in the timeline history of the ticket.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://imgur.com/POqDVuc.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Ticket resolution">
</p>
<p>
Upon completion of the ticket it will need to be closed or resolved. Resolved is always the preferable outcome, on occasion, closing may be preferable. 

When there's been no response from the user after multiple attempts to contact them, the issue is deemed a duplicate or spurious, or when the user indicates the issue is resolved but doesn't explicitly confirm resolution by closing the ticket. Closing would be prefferable.
